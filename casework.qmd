## üßÆ Process Optimization project ‚Äì Outlook India  
Over the course of my internship, I created and implemented a centralized budget tracking system for the editorial department to meet an existing need for cost reporting and management. The solution fused disparate data feeds into a single integrated and user-friendly platform that facilitated real-time tracking of project expenditure. Budget authorization and reconciliation processing time were reduced by 25% as a result and accountability among editorial teams improved through greater transparency and defined budget ownership. I collaborated with editorial management and finance staff to design reporting parameters and developed automated classification rules to ensure accuracy and consistency. The system was embraced by senior management as a best practice model across other departments and as a springboard for additional electronic process improvement.
