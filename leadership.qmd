# 🌟 My Approach to Leadership

Leadership isn't a title, but a foundation of trust, a drive for action, and problem-solving with purpose. Whether I am working to transform systems or supporting a colleague, I seek to lead by working together, by talking, and by making things clear.

Leadership involves influencing, not directing.

# 💼 Leadership in Action – ERP Coordination

At Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, where I did my internship, I was involved in a full country rollout of Microsoft Dynamics 365. Although I did not have an official leadership position, I:

Worked together with all cities' finance teams
- Improved processes for performing user testing and training team members Provided support in intercompany coordination among regional subsidiaries

Through this action, I practiced leadership without formal authority and established trust in team communication and problem-solving.

# 👥Peer Support and Mentorship

- At Outlook India, I assisted in training the other interns on learning reporting processes and Excel automation.
- I provide informal mentoring to undergraduate business students through LinkedIn resume critiques, career counsel, and interview coaching.

These experiences taught me about being gentle and how to be a leader in quiet but strong ways.
